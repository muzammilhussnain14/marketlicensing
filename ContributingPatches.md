# Introduction #

This document provides instructions for developers who wish to submit a patch to the Market Licensing Library.

# Prerequisites #

Before submitting code, you must have a CLA (Contributor License Agreement) on file with Google.

The CLA can be downloaded and electronically signed at the addresses below:

Individual CLA: http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html<br>
Corporate CLA: <a href='http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html'>http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html</a>

<h1>Submitting Code</h1>

Once your CLA has been submitted, you can either:<br>
<br>
1. Export your changes as a patch file (use the "hg export" command if possible), or<br>
2. Crate a clone of this project, and push your changes into the clone<br>
<br>
Once you have either a patch file or a clone of the repository, send a Review Request using the link below:<br>
<br>
<a href='http://code.google.com/p/marketlicensing/issues/entry?template=Review%20request'>http://code.google.com/p/marketlicensing/issues/entry?template=Review%20request</a>

A project owner will review your code, respond with any changes that need to be made, and  (assuming everything looks good) merge your changes into the mainline repository.<br>
<br>
To help expedite the review process, make sure any contributions include appropriate documentation and JUnit tests. Patches without documentation or tests will be rejected.
